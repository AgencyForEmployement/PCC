# PCC - Payment Card Center


This service mediates interbank communication of this type, and accepts a request for a transaction from the seller's bank and forwards it to the buyer's bank

he backend is a Maven Spring Boot application. Source code is in the <i>./PCC/pcc</i> folder. It can be started normally as a Java project in Eclipse or IntelliJ. I used Java 11 version. The server is running on port 8083.\
PostgreSQL is needed for the backend.
